## üîê API Security Overview

### Key Measures

- **Authentication**: Users must log in using secure credentials; token-based or session-based mechanisms.
- **Authorization**: Ensures users can only access or modify resources they own or are permitted to use.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects the API from abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures sensitive data like passwords and payment info are encrypted.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents SQL injection and XSS by validating all inputs.

### Importance

- **User Data Protection**: Securing user credentials and personal information.
- **Transaction Security**: Ensures safe and reliable financial operations.
- **System Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized access and potential system compromises.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the building, testing, and deployment of code. It enhances efficiency, consistency, and code quality by catching bugs early and deploying code faster.

### Why CI/CD is important

- Automation: CI/CD automates testing, building, and deployment, which reduces the manual effort required to maintain the project. This ensures that developers can focus on writing code rather than worrying about the deployment process.

- Faster Development Cycle: CI/CD pipelines enable rapid development by automatically running tests and deploying code changes as soon as they are committed. This speeds up the delivery of features, bug fixes, and updates.

- Improved Quality: Automated testing in CI ensures that the code is continuously checked for errors, which reduces the chances of bugs making it to production. This improves the overall stability of the application.

- Consistency: Automated deployments ensure that the code is consistently deployed in the same environment, reducing the chances of discrepancies between development, testing, and production environments.

- Feedback Loop: Developers receive immediate feedback on their changes, allowing them to address issues quickly and improve the code continuously.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: For automating testing, linting, and deployment tasks.
- **Docker**: To package applications into containers for consistent environments across dev, test, and production.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: To ensure code quality before commits reach the main branch.
- **Jenkins**: A widely used open-source automation server for building and deploying code in CI/CD pipelines.
- **CircleCI**: Another popular CI/CD tool for automating workflows and ensuring fast deployments.
- **Travis CI**: A cloud-based CI/CD tool that integrates well with GitHub repositories for automated builds and tests.
